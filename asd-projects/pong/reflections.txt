### User Story / Gameplay
- Describe the gameplay
    A ball bouncing between two "paddles"
- What are the conditions when the game begins?
    The game sets the ball's position to a median value and drifts it toward Player 1's side. Points are set to 0 for each side.
- Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
    The game ends when either side reaches the goal point value.
- What `if`s will there be?
    If the ball touches the right edge of the box, player 1 gets the point. The left, player 2 gets the point. If either value reaches 5, the game ends.


### Visual Game Components:
- What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
    A ball, net, a board, and two "paddles"
  - Which will be static? (the board)
      The net and board
  - Which will be animated? (the box)
      The ball and paddles
- What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were `positionX`, `speedX`, and `points`.
      The paddles require positionX and speedY.
      The ball requires speedX and SpeedY.
      Each paddle will have a points value associated with it.


### Events / Logic 
- What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
    Keyboard events for paddles, to track movement up and down.
    Possibly a timer for games that last too long.
    Detection when the ball reaches a goal zone.
- How do those events affect the data of the program?
    The paddles are what the ball bounces off of, and is how players prevent the other from scoring.
    When the ball reaches a goal zone, points are added to the correct player.
- For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
    If keyUP or W is pressed, the corresponding paddle's Y value decreases by speedY, and the paddle appears to move upward.
    If keyDown or S is pressed, the corresponding paddle's Y value increases by speedY, and the paddle appears to move downward.
    When the ball reaches the right edge of the board, player 1's paddle's point value goes up by 1.
    When the ball reaches the left edge of the board, player 2's paddle's point value goes up by 1.
