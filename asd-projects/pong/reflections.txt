### User Story / Gameplay
- Describe the gameplay
    A ball bouncing between two "paddles"
- What are the conditions when the game begins?
    The game sets the ball's position to a median value and drifts it toward Player 1's side. Points are set to 0 for each side.
- Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
    The game ends when either side reaches the goal point value.
- What `if`s will there be?
    If the ball touches the right edge of the box, player 1 gets the point. The left, player 2 gets the point. If either value reaches 5, the game ends.


### Visual Game Components:
- What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
    A ball, net, a board, and two "paddles"
  - Which will be static? (the board)
      The net and board
  - Which will be animated? (the box)
      The ball and paddles
- What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were `positionX`, `speedX`, and `points`.
      The paddles require positionX and speedY.
      The ball requires speedX and SpeedY.
      Each paddle will have a points value associated with it.


### Events / Logic 
- What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
    Keyboard events for paddles
- How do those events affect the data of the program?
- For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
